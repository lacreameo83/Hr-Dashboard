### Data cleaning and preparation

in the initial data preparation phase, we performed the following tasks:
1. data loading and inspection
2. handing of missing values
3. data cleaning and formatting

### Exploratory Data Analysis

- what is the overall salary spent?
- staffs that are both active and meets the organization requiremwnt?
- where are the employee located?
- how much spent on non active employee?

### Results findings 

 The analysis findings can be summarized as follows:

1. The company's salary expenditure amounts to $21.5 million.

2. $15 million is allocated to male employees.

3. $7 million is spent on non-active employees.

4. The company invests more in U.S. citizens.

5. Employees who are both active and fully meeting the requirements include:

    - Candie Calvin
    - Linda Anderson
    - Helen Billis
    - Kera Harrison
    - Leonared Lindsay
    - Jeonnite
    - Tayen

 ### Recommendations 

 Based on my findings, we recommend the following action:
 
- Non-active employees receive nearly the same average salary as active employees, prompting consideration for either salary reductions or replacement with active workers. Additionally, active and fully meeting employees should be prioritized for promotion and incentivized to maintain high performance levels.

### Limitations
-There are no constraints; I utilized the precise dataset without altering any figures.
